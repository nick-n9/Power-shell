Explanation:
Connection details: Specify your SQL Server connection information such as the server name, database name, username, and password.
File Path: Define the path to the pipe-delimited text file you want to import.
Import-Csv: This cmdlet is used to read the pipe-delimited file and parse it into objects.
SQL Insert: We dynamically build an INSERT INTO SQL query using the column names from the file and their corresponding values.
Invoke-Sqlcmd: This cmdlet is used to execute the SQL query for inserting data into SQL Server.
Notes:
Make sure you replace your_sql_server, your_database, your_username, your_password, and your_table with actual values.
Ensure that SQLPS module is installed for Invoke-Sqlcmd. If it's not installed, you can install it using Install-Module -Name SqlServer in PowerShell.
The script assumes that the SQL table already exists and has the correct schema. If necessary, modify the script to match the file's structure to the table's columns
